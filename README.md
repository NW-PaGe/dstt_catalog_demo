# DSTT: Data Catalog Demo

## This repository serves as a deployable Shiny app which serves a self-contained sequencing data catalogue.

All datasets and code responsible for creating a data catalogue using Shiny is self-contained within this reposistory. This project is meant to serve as a minimum viable product to demonstrate how datasets can be catalogued into a dashboard even without access to standard catalogue tools or when direct connections to datasets cannot be established.

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**:

All datasets in this repository __must not__ contain any personally identifiable information (PII). Any demographic fields must be scrubbed or mock data must be created.

Do not include sensitive data: credentials, tokens, database connection strings, etc.

### Logging Issues (report a bug)

To log an issue, create an issue within the diqa-dbx-sequencing reposistory. Provided as much information w/ the error messages, examples and/or screenshots if possible. Ensure the issue is appropriately tagged.
